Hi 
this is my onlineShop 
i started it with vite and you should run commands above after clone the git repo to your local project
1.npm install -g vite
2.npm i
and you are ready to go BUT do not forget that the backend of this pdoject is add to the repo as well so for running backend simply open the server folder on your VSCode and in the terminal type "npm run bakend" or in the package.json file go to the backend part hover on it and select the runScript command 
now you are really ready to Go
